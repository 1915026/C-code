# Game of Life
I found this task really very interesting. Firstly I explored what GoL actually is and its rules which were as follows :-

  + Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
  + Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
  + Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
  + Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Firstly I found it quite difficult as very few tutorials were availabe for the same (particularly in C language).

Then I found this :- [https://youtu.be/flYIkz4XHQc](https://youtu.be/flYIkz4XHQc)
which was very helpful as he explianed it step by step.

For more clarity of the code I took help of @jaswant, GD member.

In case the user donot pass command line arguments, so I have used scanf as well as command line arguments to get input for number of rows and columns.

I have a doubt, what if I want to execute this on browser while taking input from user.
